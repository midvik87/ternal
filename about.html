          <!-- <h3>About <span class="hollow">Us</span></h3> -->
          <p>Today, information of the deceased and thus of our places is reduced to a name, surname and year of birth
            and death.</p>
          <p>
            Despite today‘s digital age, cemeteries are still in the stone age. For centuries, graves have remained the
            same; there‘s always a stone slab with only a name and date of birth and death of the deceased. But we don’t
            want to be anonymous, we all want to leave a trace, we want to be remembered. It‘s in human nature. So, it‘s
            time to say farewell to the stone age and say hello to the digital age.</p>
          <p>
            iTernal, our digital tombstone, our digital memorial and our digital columbarium, eliminates this anonymity
            and gets us more information about the deceased.</p>
          <p>
            It’s no longer just a head of the grave, holder of the name or an image of the deceased while it becomes a
            story of the deceased and calls to eternity.</p>

        <h4>Digital Cemetery</h4>
        <p>The digital cemetery is a reflection of a new era that has advanced so much with the development of
          technology that we can also change the millennial patterns of human behaviour.</p>
        <p>Attitudes toward death and the dead have changed radically in most societies by the 21st century. But the end
          of life is still understood in the same way as it used to be. Each of us would like to leave behind something
          that would remind our descendants that we lived and that we left a TRACE.</p>
        <p> And unlike in the past, when this was only possible for a group of privileged and wealthy people who could
          erect monumental monuments (pyramids, mausoleums, monumental tombs…), today's technology allows this for just
          about every one of us.</p>
        <p>
          The digital cemetery consists of classic free-standing digital tombstones, digital cremation niches and a
          digital memorial wall. Each element of this cemetery offers the individual unlimited opportunities to show his
          life, achievements, joy… in short, everything that anyone wants to say about himself and show to his
          descendants.</p>
        <p>A digital cemetery can be part of an existing cemetery, an addition to it, or a completely new cemetery. An
          integral part of the cemetery is also a small solar power plant, hidden behind a memorial wall and greenery,
          with green energy supplying the entire complex.

          <h3>Digital Tombstone</h3>
          <h4> — a personalized digital tombstone which is flexible and easy to change the content, has unlimited space
            and comparable price, as well as personal touch.</h4>
          <p>Today's inscriptions on tombstones are very short; they do not tell us more than just basic information
            about the deceased or his family.</p>
          <p>Usually, only the name and two dates remain after your death, but now you have the opportunity to escape
            from such anonymity. Modern, digital age has brought many new opportunities, both in life and after death,
            although it may sound a bit strange. In funeral industry, 99% of people use traditional stone tombstone.</p>
          <p>We can say that cemeteries are still in the Stone Age. Besides physical problems of stone (not flexible,
            heavy, not easy to be rewritten, has limited space, its letters cannot be enlarged) we cannot avoid the fact
            that there is no personal and emotional connection between the deceased and his loved ones because stone is
            cold and impersonal.</p>
          <p>iTernal represents both changes: physical and emotional, and becomes a personalized digital tombstone which
            is flexible and easy to change the content, has unlimited space and comparable price, as well as personal
            touch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Already at the time of your life, you can put on digital tombstone a lot more information about your life,
            work, hobbies, happy moments and sad events; so that your descendants or just passers-by at the cemetery can
            get to know you better.</p>
          <p>
            In digital age, tombstone is no longer just a head of the grave, holder of the name or an image of the
            deceased; digital tombstone is no longer just an extended memory of the deceased. It becomes a story of the
            deceased and calls to eternity.</p>

          <h4>iTernal 01 – H700xW400xD150 - 36" diagonal of whole Digital Tombstone (32" monitor)</h4>
          <p>Diagonal of the entire DT 01 is 36"; diagonal of the display is 32". The screen is combined with the
            protective glass. Between the screen and the glass is a special resin which ensures that the screen does not
            overheat in the heat and does not freeze in the cold.</p>
          <p>The frame is made of artificial black stone; it stands on a metal frame which gives it some extra strength
            and stability.</p>
          <p>Besides display with a computer (designed for over 100.000 hours of operation or over 10 years of 24/7
            operation); the housing also includes temperature sensor, light sensor, high power fans & 2pcs heater
            build-in, working temperature between around -25°C and +40°C (with temperature sensor and light sensor DT
            runs very well in high temperature and has a very stable performance; the 2pcs heater makes it run in very
            cold temperature); battery (Li-ion; AGM).
          </p>
          <p>
            At the rear of the housing is a small door for access to the screen and the computer. The computer program
            is complemented by software. DT 01 weighs around 50 kg and is powered via the 220V cable (option: via solar
            panel).

          <h3>Digital Columbarium</h3>
          <h4> — world’s first innovative, future oriented and completely digital Columbarium for 40 cremation niches.
          </h4>
          <p>iTernal is not integrated into a classic Columbarium (but it can be); it is a complete Columbarium for 40
            digital cremation niches that works in all weather conditions and parts of the day.</p>
          <p>iTernal is basically a digital function system.
            The concept of lost – death, funeral, cemetery, grave, tombstone, and columbarium is not easy to deal with
            by the majority of people.</p>
          <p>We most likely don't discuss about those things and ignore them because they are linked to emotional pain
            and loss. Besides that this is the area of a very traditional and conservative thinking. So, with a digital
            columbarium we’re breaking with those taboos and tradition. </p>
          <p>
            By the looks, iTernal is very much alike the traditional stone columbarium.</p>
          <p>The display is integrated in the frame (natural stone or imitation of marble); being on standby only the
            name and dates of birth and death of the deceased are seen. When one stands in front of the iTernal for a
            few seconds the motion sensor activates the content of digital columbarium (photos, texts and videos).</p>
          <p>iTernal, our digital columbarium, can be of any shapes and sizes, different quality, adapted to various
            weather conditions, equipped with security features, motion sensor, audio and off-the-grid capabilities,
            advanced human-computer interfaces, it is wireless, powered with solar or 110/220V energy.

          <h3>Digital Memorial Wall</h3>
          <h4>— a system of merged individual digital monuments with a selection of information, images and videos about
            the deceased and / or events.</h4>
          <p>iTernal is world’s first innovative, future oriented and completely personalized Digital Memorial Wall that
            works in all weather conditions and parts of the day.</p>
          <p>In fact, iTernal is a system of merged individual digital monuments with a selection of information, images
            and videos about the deceased and / or events.</p>
          <p>It represents direct personal and emotional connection between the deceased, past events and today's public
            (relatives, visitors, tourists, students …). For the first time, it enables that we take care of people and
            events that are important for past, present and future generations.</p>
          <p>With a selection of images and more information about them, iTernal becomes a story of the deceased and the
            past events.</p>
          <p>The history of a place is not only the dates and events that are important for the city. The past and
            present are created by people, each with their own story, a part of the whole.
          </p>
          <p>The digital era which has not yet paved the way to the cemetery, enables today that we maintain the stories
            of people who lived and created the image of our places. Each in their own way, they help to shape the
            history.
